# Project 4 - Operating System Simulator

This project simulates an operating system scheduler using inter-process communication (IPC) with shared memory and message queues. It manages multiple user processes, scheduling them based on specified time quanta, and tracks their execution in a simulated clock.

## Repository
GitHub: [cs4760-Project4](https://github.com/masfm8/cs4760-Project4)

## Files
- `oss.c`: The main file for the simulated operating system scheduler. Manages process creation, scheduling, message handling, and cleanup.
- `user.c`: Represents a user process that interacts with the scheduler, utilizing assigned time quanta and sending messages back to `oss`.
- `Makefile`: Automates the compilation of `oss` and `user` executables.
- `README.md`: Documentation on how to compile and run the project.

## Compilation
To compile the project, use the provided `Makefile`:
```bash
make


This will generate two executables:

oss: The scheduler.
user: The user process, which is forked by oss.
Running the Project
After compilation, run the scheduler:
./oss
The scheduler will create and manage user processes up to a specified maximum (e.g., 20). It will terminate after approximately 3 real-time seconds or when all processes have finished.

Simulation Output
The program prints logs for:

Launching new user processes
Process time usage reports
Updates to the simulated system clock
Termination signals and cleanup messages

Example output:
OSS: Launched user process PID 12345
OSS: Received time used 50 ns from PID 12345
OSS: Updated clock: 0s 50ns
...
OSS: User process PID 12345 has terminated.
OSS: Cleaned up shared memory and message queue.

This `README.md` should help users understand the projectâ€™s purpose, 
how to compile and run it, and the key configuration and cleanup steps. 
Let me know if you need further adjustments or additional sections!
